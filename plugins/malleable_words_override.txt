# Consider situation where the request originates from Azure Functions serverless 
# redirector. Such request will egress from IP with geolocation's organization
# field containing phrase:
#    "Microsoft Azure Cloud (westeurope)"
#
# Should there be "Microsoft" keyword specified in malleable_banned_words.txt wordlist, 
# the request would be banned. If we don't want that, this wordlist can override 
# blocking behaviour for specific phrases.
#
# The same goes if your beacon operates over Amazon AWS Lambda service. Typically AWS CIDRs
# are going to be blacklisted, but you can easily override that here.
